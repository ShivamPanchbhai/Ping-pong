# Ping-pong
This  project is a ping pong game developed in Python with the help of Turtle and winsound module.


I have made this game in python by using the turtle module.

First I set up the screen dimensions and background colour.

then, I set up the 2 paddles and 1 ball.

then, I created a function for up and down movement of both the paddle.

then I assigned key bindings to both the paddles.

Then I wrote the function for the movement of the ball. 

Then we set the collision boundaries of the top, bottom, left and right by looking at the coordinates of the screen

Then we set the paddle and ball collisions

We added scoreboard for players and set the conditions when the points should be given to players

We added the sound when it touches the boundary and paddles
