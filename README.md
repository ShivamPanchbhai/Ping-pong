# Ping-pong
This  project is a ping pong game developed in Python with the help of Turtle and winsound module.

First I set up the screen dimensions and background colour.

Then, I set up the 2 paddles and 1 ball.

After that, I created a function for 'UP' and 'Down' movement of both the paddles.

Then I assigned key bindings to both the paddles.

After that I wrote the function for the movement of the ball. 

Then I set the collision boundaries of the top, bottom, left and right according to the coordinates of the screen

After that I programmed for the paddle and ball collisions.

Then I added scoreboard for players and set the conditions of giving points to the players.

Lastly I added the sound, when the ball touches the boundaries and paddles.
